# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Project 

##  Overview

This repository demonstrates use-cases and integrations of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — an open-source, model-agnostic standard developed by Anthropic to connect LLMs with external data sources, services, and tools . 

##  What is MCP?

MCP acts like a “USB‑C port for AI,” providing a universal protocol for LLM applications to securely **read**, **write**, and **execute** actions outside their native context — across file systems, APIs, databases, and more .

##  Why MCP Matters

- **Solves the N×M integration problem**: Build once, integrate everywhere, avoiding custom connectors for each tool  
- **Model-agnostic interoperability**: MCP works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.   
- **Supports agentic workflows**: Facilitates dynamic, multi-step agent behavior across tools

##  Architecture

- **MCP Host**: LLM-powered application (e.g., Claude Desktop, IDE)
- **MCP Client**: Mediates host ↔ server, ensuring sandboxed communication
- **MCP Server(s)**: Connectors exposing tools/resources (e.g., GitHub, Postgres)  
- **Transport**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over standard transports
